# Pydantic Tutorial

This repository contains a series of Python scripts demonstrating the features and usage of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), a data validation and settings management library using Python type annotations.

## Files Overview

- **1_pydantic_why.py**: Introduction to why Pydantic is useful.
- **2_field_validator.py**: Demonstrates field-level validation in Pydantic models.
- **3_model_validator.py**: Shows how to use model-level validators.
- **4_computed_fields.py**: Explains computed fields in Pydantic models.
- **5_nested_models.py**: Covers working with nested models.
- **6_serialization.py**: Demonstrates serialization and parsing with Pydantic.

## Getting Started
 
1. **Install Pydantic** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   pip install pydantic 
   ```
2. **Run the scripts**:
   ```bash
   python 1_pydantic_why.py
   # ...and so on for other files
   ```

## About Pydantic
Pydantic enforces type hints at runtime and provides user-friendly errors when data is invalid. It is widely used for data parsing, validation, and settings management in modern Python projects.
